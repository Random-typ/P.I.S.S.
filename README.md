# P.I.S.S.
 P.I.S.S. is an empirically grounded, collaborative data experiment, measuring the Sequencing and Amount of Fluid Put-through in Humans. The goal is simple: Visualize Findings, in the Framework of
PCI (Piss Correlation Index) and instigate further Study in the Field of Urine Research.

Our Team of Experts, brought together by shared biological constraints, has been hard at Work, bringing P.I.S.S to Life. The Project had its Inception in 2020 ,amidst the "Heimscheißer"-Epidemic, first Prototypes of P.I.S.S failed to provide conclusive Data. The current Version on the other Hand has already proven successful enough for a public Release. Communal Pissing is heavily encouraged!
